👋 Hi, I’m @Unknow-git
👀 I’m interested in learning as many things as I can, especially in programming and technology.
🌱 I’m currently learning C# and exploring game development.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with anyone who shares my passion for coding and creativity.
📫 How to reach me: I'm a bit mysterious, but you can drop a message here!
😄 Pronouns: none in particular.
⚡ Fun fact: I find joy in the little things, and I’m always eager to share a smile.
💡 I'm also interested in open-source projects and contributing to communities.
